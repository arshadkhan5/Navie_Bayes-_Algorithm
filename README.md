# Navie_Bayes_Algorithm
It is based on Navie Bayes Theorem 
## Navie Bayes Theorm
Navie Bayes Theorm determine conditional probabolity.Through it we create Frequency Table 
### Conditional Probabality
it means to predict probabality of one thing from the probabality of another 
### Frequency Table 
How many times a particular value occure in a particular column

## Types of Navie Bayes 
## 1) Gaussion Navie Bayes 
It is used when the Independent values are in numeric form 

## 2) Multinominal Navie Bayes 
Use for Multiclass Classification when the the input values in Text form 

## 3) Bernouli Navie Bayes 
Use for Binary Classification when the input data is in text form
